/* The Neighbor Cache is modelled in Java, because Android/Java won't
 * give access to the network stack.
 * 
 * The primary task of the cache is to map IPv6-addresses in byte [16]
 * format to a destination, which is stored as a Inet4SocketAddress
 * for direct use with DatagramPacket facilities in Java.  A hash is
 * used to gain fast access to the target object.
 * 
 * To find mappings, the cache will send up to 3 Neighor Solicitation
 * messages to the direct peer.  During this period it will pass through
 * states ATTEMPT1 to ATTEMPT3, and finally become FAILED.  This is a sign
 * that no further attempts need to be made until the expiration of the
 * mapping, about 30 seconds after starting it.  This process starts
 * when an unknown peer is approached, or one that is STALE.
 * 
 * If a Neighbor Advertisement comes in, this information is sent here
 * for processing.  The cache entry will usually go to REACHABLE in such
 * situations.
 * 
 * When traffic comes in with the direct address of this peer as its
 * destination, then the cache is informed; if no mapping in REACHABLE
 * state exists, then new attempts are started, so as to enable direct
 * connectivity after the remote peer has opened a hole to us.
 * 
 * The cache maintains a seperate timer queue for each state, and will
 * act upon the objects if they expire.  This makes the queue rather
 * self-controlled.
 * 
 * Before changing any piece of this code, please assure yourself that
 * you understand each single synchronized section, and convince
 * yourself that you understand the trick in NeighborQueue.dequeue().
 * This is not just multitasking code; it may well be the most complex
 * example of multitasking code that you ever came accross.  Do not
 * change the code unless you are absolutely certain that you have
 * understood all the invariants that make this code work!

	 * but the cache may asynchronously attempt to find a direct path to the
	 * neighbor.
	 * 
	 * The "playful" argument is rather special.  When set to true, it
	 * indicates that an initial experiment attempting to contact the
	 * neighbor directly is acceptable.  This is usually the cae if the
	 * following conditions apply:
	 *  1. The message is resent upon failure
	 *  2. Success can be recognised and reported back here
	 *  Setting this flag causes the first (and only the first) result
	 *  from lookup_neighbor to point directly to the host; resends will
	 *  be sent through the tunnel, while a few neighbor discoveries are
	 *  still tried towards the remote peer, until something comes back
	 *  directly to acknowledge contact.  When something comes back over
	 *  a direct route, this should be reported to the neighbor cache
	 *  through received_peer_direct_acknowledgement() so it can
	 *  learn that future traffic can be directly sent to the peer.
	 *  
	 * A common case for which this holds is TCP connection setup:
	 *  1. Packets with SYN are sent repeatedly if need be
	 *  2. Packets with ACK stand out in a crowd
	 * So, when TCP packets with SYN are sent, their lookup_neighbor()
	 * invocation can set the playful flag; the first attempt will go
	 * directly to the peer and hopefully initiate direct contact; if
	 * not, future attempts are sent through the tunnel.  When the
	 * remote peer accepts, it will return a packet with ACK set over
	 * the direct route, which is enough reason to signal success to
	 * the neighbor cache.  Interestingly, the first reply message
	 * from a TCP server will generally hold the SYN flag as well, so
	 * if the remote 6bed4 stack is also playful about TCP, it is
	 * likely to send it back directly even if it received the opening
	 * SYN through the tunnel.  This means that even a blocking NAT on
	 * the remote end will cause a new attempt on return.  As usual,
	 * an ACK from client to server follows, which asserts to the
	 * server that it can talk directly (because, at that time, the
	 * client has picked up on the directly sent SYN+ACK).
	 * 
	 * It is possible for TCP to initiate a connection from both ends
	 * at the same time.  Effectively this splits the SYN+ACK into
	 * two messages, one with SYN and one with ACK.  It may happen
	 * that direct contact is not correctly established if that is
	 * done, but the follow-up neighbor discovery that follow on a
	 * playful SYN that does not return an ACK over the direct route
	 * will establish NAT-passthrough if it is technically possible.
	 * A similar thing occurs when the initial SYN is lost for some
	 * reason.
